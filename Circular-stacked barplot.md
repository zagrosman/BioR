# Circular Stacked bar plot code


This code will generate a circular stacked bar plot with three main groups (A, B, C) and four subgroups (X, Y, Z, W) for each group. The subgroups are colored using a predefined set of colors, and their order is defined using the subgrp_order variable. The resulting plot will have a white background, with a legend at the bottom and a title at the top.
